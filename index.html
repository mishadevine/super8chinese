      Due to its mix of simplicity and oftentimes colorful, complex and bold 
      flavors, it's hard to classify Chinese cuisine using an adjective or two. 
      Chinese restaurants, whether in China, America or beyond, continue to use 
      staples like flour and rice to create delicious rice dishes, noodle dishes, 
      breads, dumplings and steamed buns, as well as to make beer, wine and vinegar. 
      Meats are popular in Chinese cuisine and it's not uncommon for Chinese restaurants 
      to serve pan fried or stir fried duck, beef, chicken and pork. From Peking duck to ginger beef, sesame chicken to barbecued roast park, it's unlikely for meat eaters to leave Chinese restaurants unsatisfied. Seafood dishes are also popular items found on Chinese food menus, especially those that contain crab, shrimp, lobster and scallops. If you're not a meat eater, tofu is regularly used as a meat or cheese 
      substitute.
