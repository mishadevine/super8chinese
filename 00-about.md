  Due to its mix of simplicity and oftentimes colorful, complex and bold 
  flavors, it's hard to classify Chinese cuisine using an adjective or two. 
  Chinese restaurants, whether in China, America or beyond, continue to use 
  staples like flour and rice to create delicious rice dishes, noodle dishes, 
  breads, dumplings and steamed buns, as well as to make beer, wine and vinegar. 
  Meats are popular in Chinese cuisine and it's not uncommon for Chinese restaurants 
  to serve pan fried or stir fried duck, beef, chicken and pork. From Peking duck to 
  ginger beef, sesame chicken to barbecued roast park, it's unlikely for meat eaters 
  to leave Chinese restaurants unsatisfied. Seafood dishes are also popular items 
  found on Chinese food menus, especially those that contain crab, shrimp, lobster 
  and scallops. If you're not a meat eater, tofu is regularly used as a meat or cheese 
  substitute.

  But let's not forget about the noodles and soups! From fried noodles and noodle soup 
  to chop suey, chow mein, lo mein and wonton soup, there is no shortage of tasty noodle 
  dishes and soups offered up at Chinese restaurants no matter what area you live in. And 
  as you slurp your soups and noodles, how about some tea to balance things out? China is 
  the world's largest exporter of green tea, which is known to offer a variety of health 
  benefits.
